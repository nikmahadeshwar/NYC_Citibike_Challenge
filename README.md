https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kdURPyaVSAUhauGvHOOibZxfJv6LbulX


## Overview
In this project we have used Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes. 
We have exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the visualizations. We have created a new Tableau workbook to create the visualizations and then recreated the two visualizations from the module.We have used the "Bike Utilization" graph in the Story, then created a new column that contains the converted datatype of the "tripduration" column.

## Created a visualisation that shows:
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
* Added the converted column for gender as a color to the Marks field, add it to the Filters field

## Created the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz

In this visualization, i have graphed the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.
