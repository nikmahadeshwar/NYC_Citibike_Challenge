## Overview

This project demonstrates the analysis of NYC bike sharing model. It gives insights and forwards the business proposal to replicate the model in Des Moines.

## Business Questions and Analysis:
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
* Added the converted column for gender as a color to the Marks field, add it to the Filters field

The graph above demonstrates that majority of users check out between the first twenty minutes. We can conclude that the trips are of shorter duration and the demand for the bikes is high. The number of Male users are considerably higher than female users.Also, Males tend to take slightly longer trips.

## Trips by Weekday per hour

The trend portrays that during the weekdays, maximum people use the bikes at the start and end of office hours to commute from work to home and vice versa. Also, the usage is moderate on weekends for the whole day.

The above heatmap clearly portrays Males as the highest users, commuting from work at the peak hours. For example, on Thursday  34% are Female users and 66% are males at 5PM.

Most of the subscibers are male and they use the service on weekdays.  Non-subscribers are the ones who use the service during the weekend.

The above graph demonstrates the bike usage per user with unique bike id. It clearly depicts that the max usage is 479. Most of the bikes are used regularly and might need to be repaired in near future.
